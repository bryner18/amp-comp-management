# amp-comp-management
Simple code used to manage Cisco Secured Endpoint (AMP) devices using requests.

Currently is created to delete computers given a hostname (that's what I needed that time). Yet, you can modify the code to do whatever you want since its using requests.
Ofc you need to enter your API credentials in order for it to work. Tested many times. :) change whatever you need
